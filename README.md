# pygame-snake

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using the Pygame library in Python. The game consists of a snake that moves around the screen, eating food and growing in length. The objective of the game is to avoid colliding with the boundaries of the screen or with the snake's own tail.

How to Play:

Run the game by executing the Python script snake_game.py.

Control the snake using the arrow keys on your keyboard. The snake can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.

Guide the snake to eat the food that appears on the screen. Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer.

Avoid colliding with the boundaries of the screen or with the snake's own tail. If the snake hits a boundary or its tail, the game is over.

After the game is over, press any key to restart the game.
